<h1 id="website-information">Website Information</h1>

<p>This page of the website contains useful information about the website, including my privacy and cookies’ statements.</p>

<h3 id="opinions-ownership-and-copyright">Opinions, Ownership and Copyright</h3>

<p>Except where I quote directly, all opinions expressed here are my own. They may or may not be correct; they are based on my understanding of the software and or other products that I discuss. If you think I’m wrong, I’d be grateful if you would contact me via my <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.</p>

<p>I cannot guarantee my software (i.e., any public software you can access from my GitHub repositories) has been fully tested, you use it at your own risk.</p>

<p>Apart from photographs, this work and all my public code is licensed under an <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to use any of the photographs on this site you need permission from the photograph’s owner, most of the time this is me. If you are interested in using a photograph you can contact me using my <a href="/contact">contact page</a> in the first instance.</p>

<p>You must not download images from my web server, under any circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="cookies-and-local-data">Cookies and Local Data</h3>

<p>The public version of this website does not use cookies, so there is no cookie notice. If I use cookies in the future, they will be for specific functionality (such as a sign-on page) and will be documented on this page.</p>

<p>This website does not track you and I do not pass any personal information supplied by you to third parties without your permission, <em>unless I am required to do so by law</em>. This <em>will never change</em> while I control this site’s content.</p>

<p>I do not use local storage on your browser, if this changes, the changes will be documented on this page.</p>

<h3 id="java-script">Java Script</h3>

<p>This website is aimed at people who develop software. In this day and age, I’d be surprised if any of you do not know what Java Script is. I’m assuming you do. I’m also assuming that you know how to enable and disable it.</p>

<p>It uses Java Script to improve site functionality. If you have turned Java Script off, some of the functionality will not be available to you.</p>

<h3 id="gdpr-and-privacy">GDPR and Privacy</h3>

<p>This is a personal website, so GDPR does not apply. However, I will follow the GDPR rules, I’m just not going to write about them here (I have a life).</p>

<p>I repeat, this website does not track you and I do not pass any personal information supplied by you to third parties without your permission, <em>unless I am required to do so by law</em>. This <em>will never change</em> while I control this site’s content.</p>

<p>The only personal data you give me is the information you supply via my contact page and subsequent emails. This will be stored in a secure manner.</p>
